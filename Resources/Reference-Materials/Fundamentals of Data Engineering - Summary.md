## Core Framework: The Data Engineering Lifecycle

The book centers around a holistic framework with **5 main stages** and **6 undercurrents** that support them.

### The Five Main Stages

```
Generation → Storage → Ingestion → Transformation → Serving
```

#### 1. Generation
- Data is created in source systems
- Examples: IoT devices, application databases, APIs, logs
- **Considerations:**
  - Volume, velocity, variety
  - Schema evolution
  - Data quality at source
  - Understanding upstream systems

#### 2. Storage
- Data is persisted in appropriate systems
- **Key Technologies:**
  - Object Storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)
  - Data Warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
  - Data Lakes (S3 + cataloging)
  - Data Lakehouses (Delta Lake, Iceberg, Hudi)
- **Considerations:**
  - Access patterns
  - Consistency requirements (eventual vs. strong)
  - Separation of compute from storage
  - Cost optimization (storage tiers)

#### 3. Ingestion
- Moving data from source systems to storage
- **Patterns:**
  - **Batch vs. Streaming**: Processing frequency
  - **Push vs. Pull**: Who initiates data transfer
  - **Bounded vs. Unbounded**: Finite datasets vs. continuous streams
