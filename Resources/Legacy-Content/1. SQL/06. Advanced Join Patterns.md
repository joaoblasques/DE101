# Advanced Join Patterns

## Overview

Beyond basic INNER and OUTER joins, SQL provides advanced join patterns that solve complex data relationships. These patterns are essential for data engineering tasks like finding unmatched records, hierarchical queries, and complex filtering.

---

## Review: Basic Joins

```sql
-- INNER JOIN: Only matching rows
SELECT * FROM orders o
INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- LEFT OUTER JOIN: All from left + matches
SELECT * FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- RIGHT OUTER JOIN: Matches + all from right
SELECT * FROM orders o
RIGHT JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- FULL OUTER JOIN: All rows from both
SELECT * FROM customers c
FULL OUTER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- CROSS JOIN: Cartesian product
SELECT * FROM sizes CROSS JOIN colors;
```

---

## Semi-Join (EXISTS / IN)

### What is a Semi-Join?

Returns rows from the left table where a match exists in the right table, **without duplicating** left table rows.

**Use Case:** "Find customers who have placed orders" (but don't show order details)

### Using EXISTS (Preferred)

```sql
-- Find customers who have placed orders
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, c.email
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
);
```

**How it works:**
- For each customer, checks if ANY order exists
- Returns customer once, regardless of order count
- Stops searching once first match found (efficient)

### Using IN

```sql
-- Same result using IN
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, c.email
FROM customers c
WHERE c.customer_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
    FROM orders
);
```

### EXISTS vs IN Performance

```sql
-- ✅ EXISTS: Better for large subquery results
-- Stops at first match, doesn't materialize full list
SELECT * FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
);

-- ❌ IN: Can be slower for large result sets
-- Materializes full list in memory
SELECT * FROM customers c
WHERE c.customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id FROM orders
);
```

**Best Practice:** Use **EXISTS** for better performance, especially when subquery returns many rows.

### Semi-Join Use Cases

```sql
-- Find products that have been ordered
SELECT product_id, product_name, price
FROM products p
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM order_items oi
    WHERE oi.product_id = p.product_id
);

-- Find customers in specific countries who have orders
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, c.country
FROM customers c
WHERE c.country IN ('USA', 'Canada')
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM orders o
      WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
        AND o.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
  );

-- Find categories with active products
SELECT category_id, category_name
FROM categories cat
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM products p
    WHERE p.category_id = cat.category_id
      AND p.is_active = TRUE
);
```

---

## Anti-Join (NOT EXISTS / NOT IN)

### What is an Anti-Join?

Returns rows from the left table where **NO match exists** in the right table.

**Use Case:** "Find customers who have never placed an order"

### Using NOT EXISTS (Preferred)

```sql
-- Find customers with no orders
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, c.email, c.signup_date
FROM customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
);
```

### Using NOT IN (With NULL Handling!)

```sql
-- NOT IN requires NULL handling
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, c.email
FROM customers c
WHERE c.customer_id NOT IN (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM orders
    WHERE customer_id IS NOT NULL  -- Critical: exclude NULLs!
);
```

**⚠️ NULL Trap with NOT IN:**

```sql
-- ❌ WRONG: Returns no rows if ANY customer_id is NULL
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT customer_id FROM orders);

-- ✅ CORRECT: Exclude NULLs in subquery
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (
    SELECT customer_id FROM orders WHERE customer_id IS NOT NULL
);

-- ✅ BETTER: Use NOT EXISTS (handles NULLs correctly)
SELECT * FROM customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
);
```

### Anti-Join Use Cases

```sql
-- Find products never ordered
SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name, p.price
FROM products p
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM order_items oi
    WHERE oi.product_id = p.product_id
);

-- Find customers who signed up but never purchased
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, c.signup_date
FROM customers c
WHERE c.signup_date >= '2024-01-01'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM orders o
      WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
  );

-- Find categories with no active products
SELECT cat.category_id, cat.category_name
FROM categories cat
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM products p
    WHERE p.category_id = cat.category_id
      AND p.is_active = TRUE
);

-- Find records in table A but not in table B (data validation)
SELECT a.id, a.value
FROM table_a a
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM table_b b
    WHERE a.id = b.id
);
```

---

## LEFT JOIN with NULL Check (Alternative Anti-Join)

```sql
-- Anti-join using LEFT JOIN + IS NULL
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, c.email
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.customer_id IS NULL;
```

**When to use:**
- More readable for some developers
- Can be slower than NOT EXISTS for large tables
- Useful when you need additional left table columns

**Comparison:**

| Method | Performance | NULL Handling | Readability |
|--------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| **NOT EXISTS** | Best | Automatic | Good |
| **NOT IN** | Can be slow | Manual (tricky!) | Good |
| **LEFT JOIN + NULL** | Moderate | Automatic | Excellent |

---

## Self-Join

### What is a Self-Join?

Joining a table to itself, typically to compare rows within the same table or traverse hierarchical relationships.

### Use Case 1: Hierarchical Data (Manager-Employee)

```sql
-- Find employees and their managers
SELECT
    e.employee_id,
    e.name AS employee_name,
    e.manager_id,
    m.name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
```

**Result:**
| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id | manager_name |
|-------------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| 1           | John (CEO)    | NULL       | NULL         |
| 2           | Alice         | 1          | John         |
| 3           | Bob           | 1          | John         |
| 4           | Charlie       | 2          | Alice        |

### Use Case 2: Finding Duplicates

```sql
-- Find customers with duplicate emails
SELECT
    c1.customer_id AS customer_1,
    c2.customer_id AS customer_2,
    c1.email
FROM customers c1
JOIN customers c2 ON c1.email = c2.email
    AND c1.customer_id < c2.customer_id;  -- Avoid self-match and reverse duplicates
```

### Use Case 3: Comparing Rows

```sql
-- Find products with same price
SELECT
    p1.product_id AS product_1,
    p1.product_name AS name_1,
    p2.product_id AS product_2,
    p2.product_name AS name_2,
    p1.price
FROM products p1
JOIN products p2 ON p1.price = p2.price
    AND p1.product_id < p2.product_id;

-- Find customers from same city
SELECT
    c1.customer_id AS customer_1,
    c1.name AS name_1,
    c2.customer_id AS customer_2,
    c2.name AS name_2,
    c1.city
FROM customers c1
JOIN customers c2 ON c1.city = c2.city
    AND c1.customer_id < c2.customer_id;
```

### Use Case 4: Sequence/Gap Detection

```sql
-- Find missing order IDs in sequence
SELECT
    o1.order_id AS current_id,
    o1.order_id + 1 AS missing_id
FROM orders o1
LEFT JOIN orders o2 ON o1.order_id + 1 = o2.order_id
WHERE o2.order_id IS NULL
  AND o1.order_id < (SELECT MAX(order_id) FROM orders);
```

### Use Case 5: Hierarchical Queries (Recursive)

```sql
-- PostgreSQL recursive CTE for full hierarchy
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    -- Base case: top-level employees
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        name,
        manager_id,
        name AS path,
        1 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive case
    SELECT
        e.employee_id,
        e.name,
        e.manager_id,
        eh.path || ' > ' || e.name AS path,
        eh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT
    employee_id,
    name,
    level,
    path
FROM employee_hierarchy
ORDER BY level, employee_id;
```

**Result:**
| employee_id | name    | level | path                    |
|-------------|---------|-------|-------------------------|
| 1           | John    | 1     | John                    |
| 2           | Alice   | 2     | John > Alice            |
| 3           | Bob     | 2     | John > Bob              |
| 4           | Charlie | 3     | John > Alice > Charlie  |

## LATERAL JOIN / CROSS APPLY

### What is a LATERAL Join?

Allows subquery to reference columns from preceding tables in the FROM clause. Think of it as a "for each row" operation.

**Availability:**
- PostgreSQL: `LATERAL`
- SQL Server: `CROSS APPLY` / `OUTER APPLY`
- MySQL 8.0+: `LATERAL`

### Basic LATERAL Join (PostgreSQL)

```sql
-- For each customer, get their 3 most recent orders
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    recent.order_id,
    recent.order_date,
    recent.total_amount
FROM customers c
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT order_id, order_date, total_amount
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    ORDER BY o.order_date DESC
    LIMIT 3
) AS recent;
```

### CROSS APPLY vs OUTER APPLY (SQL Server)

```sql
-- CROSS APPLY: Like INNER JOIN (only customers with orders)
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    recent.order_id,
    recent.total_amount
FROM customers c
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 3 order_id, order_date, total_amount
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    ORDER BY o.order_date DESC
) AS recent;

-- OUTER APPLY: Like LEFT JOIN (all customers, NULL if no orders)
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    recent.order_id,
    recent.total_amount
FROM customers c
OUTER APPLY (
    SELECT TOP 3 order_id, order_date, total_amount
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    ORDER BY o.order_date DESC
) AS recent;
```

### LATERAL Use Cases

#### Use Case 1: Top N per Group

```sql
-- Top 3 products per category by sales
SELECT
    c.category_id,
    c.category_name,
    top_products.product_id,
    top_products.product_name,
    top_products.total_sales
FROM categories c
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT
        p.product_id,
        p.product_name,
        SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) AS total_sales
    FROM products p
    JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
    WHERE p.category_id = c.category_id
    GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name
    ORDER BY total_sales DESC
    LIMIT 3
) AS top_products;
```

#### Use Case 2: Running Calculations

```sql
-- For each order, calculate customer's lifetime value up to that point
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.customer_id,
    o.order_date,
    o.total_amount,
    ltv.lifetime_value
FROM orders o
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS lifetime_value
    FROM orders o2
    WHERE o2.customer_id = o.customer_id
      AND o2.order_date <= o.order_date
) AS ltv
ORDER BY o.customer_id, o.order_date;
```

#### Use Case 3: Complex Aggregations

```sql
-- Get customer stats for different time periods
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    stats_30d.order_count AS orders_last_30d,
    stats_30d.total_spent AS spent_last_30d,
    stats_all.order_count AS orders_all_time,
    stats_all.total_spent AS spent_all_time
FROM customers c
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT
        COUNT(*) AS order_count,
        SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
      AND o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30' DAY
) AS stats_30d
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT
        COUNT(*) AS order_count,
        SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
) AS stats_all;
```

### LATERAL vs Window Functions

Some LATERAL use cases can be solved with window functions, but not all:

```sql
-- ✅ Window function approach (when possible)
SELECT
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    total_amount,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) AS rn
FROM orders
WHERE rn <= 3;

-- ✅ LATERAL approach (more flexible for complex logic)
SELECT c.customer_id, recent.order_id
FROM customers c
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT order_id
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
      AND o.status = 'completed'
      AND o.total_amount > 100
    ORDER BY o.order_date DESC
    LIMIT 3
) AS recent;
```

**When to use LATERAL:**
- Need TOP N with complex filtering in subquery
- Subquery depends on outer table columns
- Complex aggregations per row
- When window functions can't express the logic

---

## Inequality Joins

### Range Joins

```sql
-- Find overlapping date ranges (event scheduling conflicts)
SELECT
    e1.event_id AS event_1,
    e1.event_name AS name_1,
    e2.event_id AS event_2,
    e2.event_name AS name_2
FROM events e1
JOIN events e2 ON
    e1.event_id < e2.event_id  -- Avoid self-match and duplicates
    AND e1.start_time < e2.end_time
    AND e1.end_time > e2.start_time;

-- Find products in overlapping price ranges
SELECT
    p1.product_name AS product_1,
    p2.product_name AS product_2,
    p1.price AS price_1,
    p2.price AS price_2
FROM products p1
JOIN products p2 ON
    p1.product_id < p2.product_id
    AND ABS(p1.price - p2.price) <= 10;  -- Within $10 of each other
```

### Nearest Value Joins

```sql
-- Find closest price point for each product
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    p.price AS actual_price,
    pp.price_point AS nearest_tier
FROM products p
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT price_point
    FROM price_tiers pt
    ORDER BY ABS(pt.price_point - p.price)
    LIMIT 1
) AS pp;
```

---

## Multiple Join Conditions

```sql
-- Join on multiple columns and conditions
SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    p.promotion_name,
    p.discount_rate
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN promotions p ON
    o.customer_segment = p.target_segment
    AND o.order_date BETWEEN p.start_date AND p.end_date
    AND o.total_amount >= p.min_order_amount;
```

---

## Join Optimization Patterns

### Pattern 1: Pre-filter in Subquery

```sql
-- ❌ SLOW: Filter after join
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2024-01-01';

-- ✅ FAST: Filter before join
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
JOIN (
    SELECT * FROM orders
    WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
) o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### Pattern 2: Pre-aggregate Before Join

```sql
-- ✅ Aggregate first, then join (more efficient)
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    stats.order_count,
    stats.total_spent
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        COUNT(*) AS order_count,
        SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
) stats ON c.customer_id = stats.customer_id;
```

### Pattern 3: Join Ordering

```sql
-- Join smaller/filtered tables first
SELECT *
FROM large_table l
JOIN (
    SELECT * FROM medium_table WHERE filter_condition
) m ON l.id = m.id
JOIN small_table s ON m.other_id = s.id;
```

---

## Common Join Patterns in Data Engineering

### Pattern 1: Latest Record Per Group

```sql
-- Get latest order for each customer
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, latest.order_id, latest.order_date
FROM customers c
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT order_id, order_date, total_amount
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    ORDER BY o.order_date DESC
    LIMIT 1
) latest;

-- Alternative with window function
SELECT DISTINCT ON (customer_id)
    customer_id,
    order_id,
    order_date
FROM orders
ORDER BY customer_id, order_date DESC;
```

### Pattern 2: Gap Detection

```sql
-- Find customers who made purchase, then didn't for 90+ days
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    last_order.order_date AS last_order_date,
    CURRENT_DATE - last_order.order_date AS days_since_order
FROM customers c
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT order_date
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    ORDER BY order_date DESC
    LIMIT 1
) last_order
WHERE CURRENT_DATE - last_order.order_date >= 90;
```

### Pattern 3: Data Validation (Reconciliation)

```sql
-- Find mismatches between two systems
SELECT
    COALESCE(s1.id, s2.id) AS id,
    s1.value AS system1_value,
    s2.value AS system2_value,
    CASE
        WHEN s1.id IS NULL THEN 'Missing in System 1'
        WHEN s2.id IS NULL THEN 'Missing in System 2'
        WHEN s1.value != s2.value THEN 'Value Mismatch'
        ELSE 'Match'
    END AS reconciliation_status
FROM system1 s1
FULL OUTER JOIN system2 s2 ON s1.id = s2.id
WHERE s1.id IS NULL OR s2.id IS NULL OR s1.value != s2.value;
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do's

1. **Use EXISTS for semi-joins** - More efficient than IN
2. **Use NOT EXISTS for anti-joins** - Avoids NULL traps
3. **Filter early** - Apply WHERE before JOIN when possible
4. **Index join columns** - Essential for performance
5. **Use LATERAL for top-N per group** - Often clearer than window functions
6. **Use self-join for hierarchies** - Or recursive CTEs for deeper structures

### ❌ Don'ts

1. **Don't use NOT IN with nullable columns** - Use NOT EXISTS instead
2. **Don't forget self-join condition** - Always use `<` or `!=` to avoid self-match
3. **Don't over-join** - Only join tables you actually need
4. **Don't forget NULL handling** - Especially in outer joins
5. **Don't use CROSS JOIN unintentionally** - Can create massive result sets
