## Overview

dbt (data build tool) is a transformation workflow that helps data teams transform data in their warehouses using SQL and software engineering best practices. It enables analytics engineers to own the "T" in ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) by writing transformations as SELECT statements that dbt turns into tables and views.

**Key Value Proposition:** dbt combines the best practices of software engineering (version control, testing, documentation, CI/CD) with the analytical power of SQL to make data transformation accessible, reliable, and collaborative.

---

## 1.1 What is dbt?

### Core Definition

**dbt (data build tool)** is an open-source command-line tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their warehouse more effectively by:
- Writing business logic with just a SQL SELECT statement
- Managing dependencies between transformations
- Testing data quality
- Documenting data models
- Deploying with confidence

---

### The ELT Paradigm Shift

Modern data pipelines follow the **ELT pattern** (Extract, Load, Transform):

```
Traditional ETL:
Extract → Transform → Load
(Transform happens outside warehouse)

Modern ELT:
Extract → Load → Transform
(Transform happens inside warehouse)
```

**Why ELT?**
- **Cloud warehouses are powerful**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift can handle massive transformations
- **Raw data preservation**: Keep original data for reprocessing
- **Faster time-to-insight**: Load first, transform as needed
- **Cost-effective**: Pay for compute when you need it

**dbt's Role:** Owns the "T" (Transform) in ELT

---

### How dbt Works

```sql
-- You write this (a SELECT statement):
SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(order_total) AS lifetime_value
FROM {{ ref('stg_orders') }}
GROUP BY customer_id

-- dbt turns it into this:
CREATE TABLE analytics.customer_lifetime_value AS
SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(order_total) AS lifetime_value
FROM analytics.stg_orders
GROUP BY customer_id
```

**Key Mechanisms:**
1. You write SELECT queries (called **models**)
2. dbt handles the DDL (CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW)
3. dbt manages dependencies automatically using `ref()`
4. dbt runs transformations in the correct order
5. dbt tests, documents, and deploys your code

---

## 1.2 dbt Core vs dbt Cloud

### dbt Core

**Definition:** Open-source command-line tool that runs transformations locally or in CI/CD pipelines.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Free and open source
- ✅ Run locally via CLI
- ✅ Full control over infrastructure
- ✅ Integrate with any orchestration tool (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster)
- ✅ Git-based workflow
- ✅ All core transformation capabilities

**Installation:**
```bash
# Install via pip
pip install dbt-core

# Install warehouse-specific adapter
pip install dbt-snowflake  # or dbt-bigquery, dbt-redshift, dbt-postgres
```

**Typical Use Cases:**
- Local development
- Custom CI/CD pipelines
- Integration with existing orchestration
- Full infrastructure control
- Cost-conscious teams

---

### dbt Cloud

### Feature Comparison Matrix

| Feature | dbt Core | dbt Cloud |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Price** | Free | Free tier + paid plans |
| **SQL Transformations** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Testing & Documentation** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **CLI Access** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Web IDE** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Scheduler** | Manual/External | ✅ Built-in |
| **CI/CD** | Manual Setup | ✅ Built-in |
| **Lineage Graph** | CLI only | ✅ Interactive UI |
| **Collaboration** | Git-based | ✅ Enhanced |
| **RBAC** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Metadata API** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Infrastructure** | You manage | Fully managed |

---

### Decision Framework: Core vs Cloud

**Choose dbt Core when:**
- Budget is tight (it's free!)
- You have strong DevOps/engineering team
- You already have orchestration (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster)
- You need full infrastructure control
- You want to avoid vendor lock-in

**Choose dbt Cloud when:**
- You want managed infrastructure
- You need built-in scheduling
- You want less DevOps overhead
- You need role-based access controls
- Your team includes less technical users
- You want native CI/CD without setup

**Hybrid Approach:**
Many teams use **dbt Core for development** and **dbt Cloud for production** - getting the best of both worlds.

## 1.3 Key Concepts & Terminology

### Models

**Definition:** A model is a single SQL file containing a SELECT statement that defines a transformation. Each model typically creates one table or view in your warehouse.

```sql
-- models/staging/stg_customers.sql
SELECT
    id AS customer_id,
    UPPER(first_name) AS first_name,
    UPPER(last_name) AS last_name,
    email,
    created_at
FROM {{ source('raw', 'customers') }}
```

**Key Points:**
- One model = one .sql file = one table/view
- Models reference each other using `{{ ref('model_name') }}`
- Models are organized in directories
- Models are executed in dependency order

---

### Materializations

**Definition:** How dbt creates your model in the warehouse (table, view, incremental, ephemeral).

```yaml
# dbt_project.yml
models:
  my_project:
    staging:
      +materialized: view
    marts:
      +materialized: table
```

**Available Materializations:**

| Type | Description | Use Case | Rebuild Time |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| **view** | Creates a view | Fast builds, small queries | Instant |
| **table** | Creates a table | Query performance | Full rebuild |
| **incremental** | Appends/updates only new records | Large datasets | Fast |
| **ephemeral** | CTE (doesn't create object) | Intermediate logic | N/A |

---

### Sources

**Definition:** Raw tables loaded into your warehouse by EL tools (Fivetran, Stitch, Airbyte).

```yaml
# models/staging/sources.yml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: raw
    database: production
    schema: raw_data
    tables:
      - name: customers
      - name: orders
```

```sql
-- Reference in models
SELECT * FROM {{ source('raw', 'customers') }}
```

**Benefits:**
- Document where data comes from
- Test freshness of source data
- Generate lineage from source → model
- Decouple from physical table names

---

### ref() Function

**Definition:** Reference other models in your project to build dependencies.

```sql
-- models/marts/customer_lifetime_value.sql
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    SUM(o.order_total) AS lifetime_value
FROM {{ ref('stg_customers') }} c
LEFT JOIN {{ ref('stg_orders') }} o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
```

**Why use ref()?**
- ✅ Automatically builds dependency graph
- ✅ Runs models in correct order
- ✅ Environment-aware (dev/staging/prod schemas)
- ✅ Refactoring-friendly (rename models easily)

**Comparison:**
```sql
-- ❌ Bad: Hard-coded schema
SELECT * FROM analytics.stg_customers

-- ✅ Good: Using ref()
SELECT * FROM {{ ref('stg_customers') }}
```

---

### Tests

**Definition:** Assertions about your data that return failing records.

```yaml
# models/staging/stg_customers.yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: stg_customers
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: email
        tests:
          - not_null
```

**Built-in Tests:**
- `unique`: Column has no duplicates
- `not_null`: Column has no NULL values
- `accepted_values`: Column only contains specified values
- `relationships`: Foreign key integrity

**Custom Tests:**
```sql
-- tests/assert_positive_order_totals.sql
SELECT *
FROM {{ ref('stg_orders') }}
WHERE order_total <= 0
```

If this query returns rows, the test fails.

---

### Documentation

**Definition:** Descriptions of your models, columns, and data lineage automatically generated by dbt.

```yaml
# models/staging/stg_customers.yml
version: 2

models:
  - name: stg_customers
    description: "Cleaned and standardized customer data from raw source"
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        description: "Unique identifier for customer"
      - name: first_name
        description: "Customer first name (uppercased for consistency)"
      - name: email
        description: "Customer email address"
```

**Generate docs:**
```bash
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve  # Opens browser with interactive documentation
```

**What You Get:**
- Interactive lineage graph
- Column-level documentation
- Model descriptions
- Source freshness
- Test results
- Compiled SQL
