Data Engineering 101 Course Creation - Complete Prompt Project Objective Create a comprehensive, beginner-focused Data Engineering 101 course (to be converted into a book) that teaches DE fundamentals from the ground up using a structured, sequential approach. Project Scope & Differentiation DE101 Focus: Foundational data engineering concepts, tools, and practices Target audience: Complete beginners to data engineering (with basic programming knowledge) Goal: Build strong fundamentals in core DE principles, SQL, Python, and data pipeline design Approach: Sequential, ground-up learning path Emphasis: General-purpose data engineering skills applicable across industries Comparison to DEforAI: DEforAI: Advanced, ML/AI-focused data engineering (feature stores, vector DBs, MLOps) DE101: Core foundations that prepare students for any DE specialization (including DEforAI as next step) Expected overlap: Data storage, batch/streaming processing, orchestration, data quality (but at foundational level) Structure & Format Requirements Follow DEforAI Structure: Base path: /Users/jonasblasques/Dev/second-brain/01_Projects/DE101 Folder hierarchy: Research/ → Numbered chapter folders (e.g., "01. Chapter Name/") Each chapter folder contains individual markdown files as subchapters Exercises/ → Chapter-based exercise folders Projects/ → Mini-projects and capstone project Resources/ → Code templates, reference materials, architecture diagrams Required Files: README.md - Course overview, curriculum, progress tracking, milestones Chapter folders with subchapter notes Exercise structure per chapter Project definitions Content Requirements Course Specifications: Chapters: 15 chapters total Languages: Python and SQL heavy (cloud-agnostic approach) Hands-on: Include exercises and projects for each major section Learning Path: Sequential, building from basics to intermediate concepts Technology Stack: SQL: Spark SQL, PostgreSQL (cloud-agnostic) Python: Pandas, PySpark, data pipeline libraries Transformation: dbt (data build tool) Orchestration: Airflow (primary), mention Prefect/Dagster Containerization: Docker basics Version Control: Git for data projects Data Quality: Testing frameworks, validation patterns Existing Resources to Integrate Leverage Existing DE101 Content: SQL Content (01_Projects/DE101/Research/1. SQL/): 14 comprehensive SQL notes covering basics to advanced topics Include: SQL Basics, DDL/DML, joins, CTEs, window functions, JSON handling, optimization Python Content (01_Projects/DE101/Research/2. Python/): 8 Python notes on data structures, ETL, testing, monitoring, orchestration Include: Python basics, data integration, transformation, pipeline testing, Airflow dbt Content (01_Projects/DE101/Research/3. dbt/): 5 dbt notes covering fundamentals, models, testing, deployment Include: dbt setup, materializations, testing, documentation, orchestration Reference Materials (01_Projects/DE101/Research/0. Overview/): "Fundamentals of Data Engineering - Summary.md" "Designing Data-Intensive Applications - Summary.md" Research & Content Development Process Step 1: Review Existing Materials Read both book summaries for high-level DE concepts Review all existing SQL, Python, and dbt notes to understand what's already covered Identify gaps and areas needing expansion Step 2: Comprehensive Web Research Research DE fundamentals, principles, and best practices Investigate industry-standard tools and workflows Find beginner-friendly explanations and learning progressions Look for hands-on project ideas and exercise patterns Research data architecture patterns, pipeline design, and data modeling Step 3: Synthesize Multiple Sources Combine book knowledge + existing notes + web research Create well-rounded content that isn't dependent on any single source Ensure cloud-agnostic approach (show AWS/GCP/Azure examples where relevant but don't lock into one) Focus on transferable skills and timeless concepts Deliverables Phase 1: Structure & Planning Complete Table of Contents (15 chapters with subchapters) Chapter summaries with learning objectives for each chapter Folder structure matching DEforAI format Chapter progression map (how chapters build on each other) Phase 2: Content Framework Detailed subchapter breakdown for each of 15 chapters Exercise outlines for each chapter Mini-project definitions (5-7 projects throughout course) Capstone project specification (end-to-end DE pipeline) Phase 3: Tech Stack & Tooling Recommended tools for each chapter Setup guides for development environment Code template structure Reference architecture diagrams Proposed Chapter Structure Guidelines Part I: Foundations (Chapters 1-3) Introduction to Data Engineering Data engineering roles, responsibilities, and lifecycle Core concepts and terminology Part II: Core Skills (Chapters 4-7) SQL deep dive (leverage existing SQL notes) Python for data pipelines (leverage existing Python notes) Data modeling fundamentals Version control and collaboration Part III: Data Infrastructure (Chapters 8-10) Data storage systems (databases, data lakes, data warehouses) Data architecture patterns Data transformation with dbt (leverage existing dbt notes) Part IV: Data Pipelines (Chapters 11-13) Batch processing fundamentals Pipeline orchestration (Airflow + existing orchestration notes) Stream processing basics Part V: Production & Quality (Chapters 14-15) Data quality, testing, and validation Monitoring, logging, and best practices Key Success Criteria ✅ Beginner-friendly: No assumptions about prior DE knowledge ✅ Sequential: Each chapter builds naturally on previous chapters ✅ Practical: Hands-on exercises and projects throughout ✅ Cloud-agnostic: Transferable skills across platforms ✅ Comprehensive: Cover all foundational DE topics ✅ Integration: Seamlessly incorporate existing SQL, Python, dbt materials ✅ Differentiated: Clear distinction from DEforAI (foundational vs ML-focused) Action Items Before proceeding, confirm: Should I prioritize open-source tools over cloud-managed services? Any specific industries/use cases to emphasize? (e-commerce, finance, healthcare, general) Expected time commitment per chapter? (hours of study/practice) Should exercises include solutions or hints-only approach? Once confirmed, I will: Conduct comprehensive web research on DE fundamentals Analyze existing SQL, Python, and dbt notes for integration Create detailed 15-chapter Table of Contents Design chapter structure with subchapters, exercises, and projects Propose folder structure and deliverables
