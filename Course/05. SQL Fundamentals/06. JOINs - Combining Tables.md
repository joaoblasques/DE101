# 06. JOINs - Combining Tables

**Chapter:** SQL Fundamentals & Relational Databases
**Topic:** Combining data from multiple tables using INNER, OUTER, CROSS, and specialized JOIN patterns

---

## üìã Overview

Real-world data is rarely stored in a single table. Customer information lives in one table, orders in another, products in a third. JOINs are the mechanism that brings these separate tables together, enabling you to answer complex business questions that span multiple entities.

Understanding JOINs is absolutely critical for data engineering. Nearly every analytics query, dashboard, or data pipeline requires combining data from multiple sources. Whether you're building a customer 360 view, calculating revenue metrics, or enriching event streams, you'll use JOINs constantly.

This subchapter covers all JOIN types - from basic INNER JOINs to advanced patterns like self-joins and anti-joins. You'll learn not just the syntax, but when to use each type, how to avoid common pitfalls, and how to write performant JOIN queries at scale.

**Real-World Applications:**
- Customer analytics: Combine customers, orders, and products to analyze purchasing patterns
- Data enrichment: Add demographic data to transaction records for segmentation
- Data quality: Find orphaned records or missing relationships between tables
- Report building: Create comprehensive reports pulling from multiple data sources
- ETL pipelines: Join dimension and fact tables when loading data warehouses

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

After completing this subchapter, you will be able to:
- Understand how JOINs combine rows from multiple tables based on related columns
- Write INNER JOIN queries to find matching records across tables
- Use LEFT/RIGHT/FULL OUTER JOINs to include non-matching rows
- Apply CROSS JOINs to generate Cartesian products when needed
- Implement self-joins to relate a table to itself
- Use semi-joins (EXISTS) and anti-joins (NOT EXISTS) for filtering
- Join more than two tables in a single query
- Understand JOIN performance implications and optimization strategies
- Debug common JOIN issues (missing data, duplicates, Cartesian explosions)
- Choose the appropriate JOIN type for different business requirements

---

## üìö Core Concepts

### 1. How JOINs Work - The Foundation

JOINs combine rows from two or more tables based on a **join condition** - typically matching values in related columns.

#### The Join Condition

```sql
-- Basic structure
SELECT columns
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

**Key Components:**
- **table1, table2:** The tables to combine
- **ON clause:** The condition that determines which rows match
- **Join column:** Usually a foreign key in one table referencing a primary key in another

#### Example Tables

```sql
-- CUSTOMERS table
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Alice         |
| 2           | Bob           |
| 3           | Charlie       |
+-------------+---------------+

-- ORDERS table
+----------+-------------+--------------+
| order_id | customer_id | total_amount |
+----------+-------------+--------------+
| 101      | 1           | 150.00       |
| 102      | 1           | 200.00       |
| 103      | 2           | 75.00        |
| 104      | 99          | 300.00       |  -- No matching customer!
+----------+-------------+--------------+
```

---

### 2. INNER JOIN - Matching Records Only

INNER JOIN returns **only rows where the join condition matches in BOTH tables**.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.total_amount
FROM customers AS c
INNER JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

#### Result

```
+---------------+----------+--------------+
| customer_name | order_id | total_amount |
+---------------+----------+--------------+
| Alice         | 101      | 150.00       |
| Alice         | 102      | 200.00       |
| Bob           | 103      | 75.00        |
+---------------+----------+--------------+
```

**What Happened:**
- ‚úì Alice matched orders 101, 102
- ‚úì Bob matched order 103
- ‚úó Charlie (no orders) - excluded
- ‚úó Order 104 (customer_id 99 doesn't exist) - excluded

**When to Use:**
- You only want records that exist in both tables
- Finding customers who have placed orders
- Matching transactions to valid accounts
- Joining fact tables to dimension tables (data warehouse queries)

---

### 3. LEFT OUTER JOIN - Keep All Left Table Rows

LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN) returns **all rows from the left table**, plus matching rows from the right table. If no match, right table columns are NULL.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.total_amount
FROM customers AS c
LEFT JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

#### Result

```
+---------------+----------+--------------+
| customer_name | order_id | total_amount |
+---------------+----------+--------------+
| Alice         | 101      | 150.00       |
| Alice         | 102      | 200.00       |
| Bob           | 103      | 75.00        |
| Charlie       | NULL     | NULL         |  ‚Üê No orders, but still included
+---------------+----------+--------------+
```

**What Happened:**
- ‚úì Alice and Bob matched orders (same as INNER JOIN)
- ‚úì Charlie appears with NULL values (no matching orders)
- ‚úó Order 104 still excluded (it's in the right table)

**When to Use:**
- Finding customers who have NOT placed orders (WHERE order_id IS NULL)
- Including all records from main table even if related records don't exist
- Data quality checks (finding orphaned records)
- Reporting where you need to show "0" or "None" for missing data

---

### 4. RIGHT OUTER JOIN - Keep All Right Table Rows

RIGHT JOIN returns **all rows from the right table**, plus matching rows from the left table. Rarely used (can always rewrite as LEFT JOIN).

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.total_amount
FROM customers AS c
RIGHT JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

#### Result

```
+---------------+----------+--------------+
| customer_name | order_id | total_amount |
+---------------+----------+--------------+
| Alice         | 101      | 150.00       |
| Alice         | 102      | 200.00       |
| Bob           | 103      | 75.00        |
| NULL          | 104      | 300.00       |  ‚Üê Order with no customer
+---------------+----------+--------------+
```

**Practical Note:** Most developers prefer LEFT JOIN because it's more intuitive. This query is equivalent to:

```sql
-- More readable: Flip tables and use LEFT JOIN
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.total_amount
FROM orders AS o
LEFT JOIN customers AS c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
```

---

### 5. FULL OUTER JOIN - Keep All Rows from Both Tables

FULL JOIN returns **all rows from both tables**, with NULLs where no match exists.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.total_amount
FROM customers AS c
FULL OUTER JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

#### Result

```
+---------------+----------+--------------+
| customer_name | order_id | total_amount |
+---------------+----------+--------------+
| Alice         | 101      | 150.00       |
| Alice         | 102      | 200.00       |
| Bob           | 103      | 75.00        |
| Charlie       | NULL     | NULL         |  ‚Üê Customer with no orders
| NULL          | 104      | 300.00       |  ‚Üê Order with no customer
+---------------+----------+--------------+
```

**When to Use:**
- Data reconciliation (finding mismatches between two datasets)
- Merging data from two sources where records may exist in either or both
- Audit reports showing all discrepancies

**Database Support:** Not all databases support FULL OUTER JOIN (MySQL doesn't). Can emulate with UNION:

```sql
-- Emulate FULL OUTER JOIN in MySQL
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.total_amount
FROM customers c LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id

UNION

SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.total_amount
FROM customers c RIGHT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

---

### 6. CROSS JOIN - Cartesian Product

CROSS JOIN returns **every possible combination** of rows from both tables. No join condition.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    p.product_name
FROM customers AS c
CROSS JOIN products AS p;
```

#### Result (if products has 3 rows)

```
+---------------+--------------+
| customer_name | product_name |
+---------------+--------------+
| Alice         | Laptop       |
| Alice         | Mouse        |
| Alice         | Keyboard     |
| Bob           | Laptop       |
| Bob           | Mouse        |
| Bob           | Keyboard     |
| Charlie       | Laptop       |
| Charlie       | Mouse        |
| Charlie       | Keyboard     |
+---------------+--------------+
-- 3 customers √ó 3 products = 9 rows
```

**When to Use:**
- Generating all possible combinations (e.g., all date-customer pairs for gap-filling)
- Creating test data
- Building reporting scaffolds (all months √ó all categories)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** CROSS JOINs can create **massive result sets**. 1,000 rows √ó 1,000 rows = 1,000,000 rows!

---

### 7. Self-JOIN - Joining a Table to Itself

Self-joins relate rows within the **same table** by treating it as two separate tables with aliases.

#### Use Case: Employee-Manager Relationship

```sql
-- EMPLOYEES table
+------+-------+------------+
| id   | name  | manager_id |
+------+-------+------------+
| 1    | Alice | NULL       |  -- CEO (no manager)
| 2    | Bob   | 1          |  -- Reports to Alice
| 3    | Carol | 1          |  -- Reports to Alice
| 4    | Dave  | 2          |  -- Reports to Bob
+------+-------+------------+

-- Find each employee and their manager's name
SELECT
    e.name AS employee_name,
    m.name AS manager_name
FROM employees AS e
LEFT JOIN employees AS m ON e.manager_id = m.id;
```

#### Result

```
+---------------+--------------+
| employee_name | manager_name |
+---------------+--------------+
| Alice         | NULL         |  -- CEO has no manager
| Bob           | Alice        |
| Carol         | Alice        |
| Dave          | Bob          |
+---------------+--------------+
```

**Other Use Cases:**
- Finding duplicate records
- Comparing rows within the same table (before/after states)
- Hierarchical data (categories with parent categories)

---

### 8. Semi-Join (EXISTS) - Filter Based on Existence

Semi-joins use **EXISTS** to filter the left table based on whether matching rows exist in the right table. Does NOT return columns from the right table.

#### Syntax

```sql
-- Find customers who have placed at least one order
SELECT
    customer_id,
    customer_name
FROM customers AS c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders AS o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
);
```

#### Result

```
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Alice         |
| 2           | Bob           |
+-------------+---------------+
-- Charlie excluded (no orders)
```

**Key Differences from INNER JOIN:**
- No duplicate rows if a customer has multiple orders
- More efficient for filtering (doesn't build full result set)
- Can't access columns from the right table

---

### 9. Anti-Join (NOT EXISTS) - Filter Based on Non-Existence

Anti-joins use **NOT EXISTS** to find rows in the left table that do **NOT** have matches in the right table.

#### Syntax

```sql
-- Find customers who have NEVER placed an order
SELECT
    customer_id,
    customer_name
FROM customers AS c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders AS o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
);
```

#### Result

```
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 3           | Charlie       |
+-------------+---------------+
```

**Alternative: LEFT JOIN + IS NULL**

```sql
-- Equivalent using LEFT JOIN
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name
FROM customers AS c
LEFT JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;
```

**When to Use:**
- Finding missing relationships (customers with no orders, products never sold)
- Data quality checks (orphaned records)
- Identifying inactive accounts

---

### 10. Joining Multiple Tables

You can chain multiple JOINs in a single query.

#### Example: Customers ‚Üí Orders ‚Üí Order Items ‚Üí Products

```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_date,
    p.product_name,
    oi.quantity,
    oi.price
FROM customers AS c
INNER JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
INNER JOIN order_items AS oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
INNER JOIN products AS p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY c.customer_name, o.order_date;
```

**Execution Flow:**
1. Join customers to orders
2. Join result to order_items
3. Join result to products
4. Filter by date
5. Sort results

**Best Practice:** Join in order of selectivity (most restrictive filters first) for better performance.

---

## üí° Practical Examples

### Example 1: Customer Order Summary

```sql
-- Find total revenue per customer, including customers with no orders
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders,
    COALESCE(SUM(o.total_amount), 0) AS total_revenue
FROM customers AS c
LEFT JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

**Result:**
```
+-------------+---------------+--------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name | total_orders | total_revenue |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+---------------+
| 1           | Alice         | 2            | 350.00        |
| 2           | Bob           | 1            | 75.00         |
| 3           | Charlie       | 0            | 0.00          |  ‚Üê LEFT JOIN keeps Charlie
+-------------+---------------+--------------+---------------+
```

---

### Example 2: Find Inactive Customers (Anti-Join)

```sql
-- Customers who haven't ordered in the last 90 days
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    c.email
FROM customers AS c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders AS o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
      AND o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
);
```

---

### Example 3: Product Sales Report (Multiple Joins)

```sql
-- Top-selling products with category information
SELECT
    cat.category_name,
    p.product_name,
    COUNT(oi.order_item_id) AS times_ordered,
    SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_units_sold,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) AS total_revenue
FROM products AS p
INNER JOIN categories AS cat ON p.category_id = cat.category_id
INNER JOIN order_items AS oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
INNER JOIN orders AS o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
WHERE o.status = 'completed'
  AND o.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY cat.category_name, p.product_name
HAVING SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) > 1000
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Example 4: Self-Join - Finding Duplicate Customers

```sql
-- Find customers with the same email (potential duplicates)
SELECT
    c1.customer_id AS customer_id_1,
    c1.customer_name AS name_1,
    c2.customer_id AS customer_id_2,
    c2.customer_name AS name_2,
    c1.email
FROM customers AS c1
INNER JOIN customers AS c2
    ON c1.email = c2.email
    AND c1.customer_id < c2.customer_id  -- Avoid duplicates and self-matches
ORDER BY c1.email;
```

---

## üîß Code Examples

### Complete Multi-Table Analytics Query

```sql
-- Comprehensive sales analysis joining 5 tables
SELECT
    -- Customer info
    c.customer_name,
    c.country,

    -- Order summary
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders,

    -- Product details
    cat.category_name,
    p.product_name,
    SUM(oi.quantity) AS units_purchased,

    -- Financial metrics
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) AS product_revenue,
    AVG(oi.price) AS avg_unit_price

FROM customers AS c
INNER JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
INNER JOIN order_items AS oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
INNER JOIN products AS p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
INNER JOIN categories AS cat ON p.category_id = cat.category_id

WHERE o.status = 'completed'
  AND o.order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
  AND c.country IN ('USA', 'Canada', 'UK')

GROUP BY
    c.customer_name,
    c.country,
    cat.category_name,
    p.product_name

HAVING SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) > 500

ORDER BY product_revenue DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. Always Use Table Aliases

```sql
-- ‚úÖ Good: Clear aliases
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_date
FROM customers AS c
INNER JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- ‚ùå Bad: No aliases (hard to read)
SELECT
    customers.customer_name,
    orders.order_date
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

### 2. Qualify All Column Names in JOINs

```sql
-- ‚úÖ Good: Explicit table prefixes
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.total_amount
FROM customers AS c
JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- ‚ùå Bad: Ambiguous columns (will break if both tables have same column name)
SELECT
    customer_id,  -- Which table?
    customer_name,
    order_id
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON customer_id = customer_id;  -- Ambiguous!
```

### 3. Use INNER JOIN Explicitly (Not Implicit Joins)

```sql
-- ‚úÖ Good: Explicit JOIN syntax
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id
FROM customers AS c
INNER JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- ‚ùå Bad: Implicit join (old syntax, error-prone)
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id
FROM customers c, orders o
WHERE c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### 4. Put Most Selective Filters in WHERE, Not ON

```sql
-- ‚úÖ Good: Filter in WHERE clause
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_date
FROM customers AS c
INNER JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2024-01-01';  -- Filter reduces result set

-- ‚ö†Ô∏è Different results for OUTER JOINs
-- For LEFT JOIN, filters in ON vs WHERE produce different results!
```

### 5. Use EXISTS for Semi-Joins (More Efficient)

```sql
-- ‚úÖ Good: EXISTS stops at first match
SELECT customer_id, customer_name
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
);

-- ‚ùå Slower: JOIN + DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT c.customer_id, c.customer_name
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### 6. Index Foreign Keys for JOIN Performance

```sql
-- Critical for performance on large tables
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_order_id ON order_items(order_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_product_id ON order_items(product_id);
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

### 1. Cartesian Explosion (Missing Join Condition)

```sql
-- ‚ùå DISASTER: Forgot ON clause!
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o;  -- Missing ON clause = CROSS JOIN

-- If 10,000 customers and 100,000 orders:
-- Result: 1,000,000,000 rows! (Database will likely hang)

-- ‚úÖ Fixed: Add ON clause
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### 2. Duplicates from One-to-Many Joins

```sql
-- ‚ùå Wrong: Unexpected duplicates
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    SUM(c.account_balance) AS total_balance  -- WRONG!
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name;

-- If customer has 3 orders, account_balance summed 3 times!

-- ‚úÖ Fixed: Don't aggregate columns from the "one" side
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    MAX(c.account_balance) AS account_balance,  -- Use MAX/MIN/any aggregate
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name;
```

### 3. NULL Handling in OUTER JOINs

```sql
-- ‚ùå Wrong: Filters out NULLs from LEFT JOIN
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.status = 'completed';  -- This turns LEFT JOIN into INNER JOIN!

-- ‚úÖ Fixed: Move filter to ON clause OR use OR IS NULL
WHERE o.status = 'completed' OR o.status IS NULL;

-- Or put filter in ON clause (different semantics)
LEFT JOIN orders o
    ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    AND o.status = 'completed'
```

### 4. Ambiguous Column Names in GROUP BY

```sql
-- ‚ùå Error: "column reference is ambiguous"
SELECT
    customer_id,  -- Which table?
    COUNT(*)
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- ‚úÖ Fixed: Qualify column names
GROUP BY c.customer_id;
```

### 5. Wrong JOIN Type for Business Logic

```sql
-- ‚ùå Wrong: Using INNER JOIN loses customers without orders
SELECT c.customer_id, COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id;
-- Customers with 0 orders are missing!

-- ‚úÖ Correct: Use LEFT JOIN to include all customers
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

## üèãÔ∏è Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic INNER JOIN
Write a query to find all orders with customer names and order dates.

**Tables:** `customers (customer_id, customer_name)`, `orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date)`

### Exercise 2: LEFT JOIN with Aggregation
Find all customers and their total number of orders, including customers with zero orders.

### Exercise 3: Anti-Join Pattern
Find products that have never been ordered using:
1. NOT EXISTS
2. LEFT JOIN + IS NULL

Compare the query plans.

### Exercise 4: Multi-Table JOIN
Write a query joining `customers`, `orders`, `order_items`, and `products` to find:
- Total revenue per customer per product category
- Only completed orders from last 6 months
- Customers with total category spend > $500

### Exercise 5: Self-Join
Using an `employees (id, name, manager_id)` table:
1. Find all employees and their managers' names
2. Find employees who manage more than 5 people
3. Find employees who have the same manager (co-workers)

### Exercise 6: Debugging
Fix this query that's producing incorrect results:
```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_name,
    SUM(c.loyalty_points) AS total_points
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY c.customer_name;
```
(Hint: loyalty_points are being multiplied by number of orders!)

## üìù Key Takeaways

1. **INNER JOIN** returns only matching rows from both tables
2. **LEFT JOIN** keeps all rows from left table, adds NULLs for non-matches
3. **RIGHT JOIN** keeps all rows from right table (rarely used, prefer LEFT JOIN)
4. **FULL OUTER JOIN** keeps all rows from both tables with NULLs for non-matches
5. **CROSS JOIN** creates Cartesian product (all possible combinations)
6. **Self-joins** relate a table to itself using aliases
7. **Semi-joins (EXISTS)** filter based on existence without returning right table columns
8. **Anti-joins (NOT EXISTS)** find rows without matches in related table
9. Always **qualify column names** with table aliases in multi-table queries
10. Use **explicit JOIN syntax** (not comma-separated FROM clause)
11. **Index foreign keys** for JOIN performance on large tables
12. Be careful of **duplicate rows** when joining one-to-many relationships
13. **WHERE filters** on LEFT JOIN can turn it into INNER JOIN if not careful
14. For filtering, use **EXISTS** instead of JOIN + DISTINCT for better performance
15. **Plan JOIN order** - most selective joins first for better performance
